"Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind." - Albert Einstein (this was my high school yearbook quote)

Science tells what is, religion tells us what we ought to do. I am sure many of my readers are familiar with this argument.

Today, with the validity of religious texts facing ever greater scrutiny, and people questioning in ever greater numbers what religion has to offer, the moral argument for religion is one of the most popular among religious apologists. In fact, I would say that it is the only argument used by apologists when debating atheists. These apologists argue that science cannot provide moral values. Science simply tells us what is. It can not provide any grounds for claiming what ought to be, or what we should value. Religion, the argument goes, can provide ultimate moral values, since the values come from a higher power (God).

I have to say that I am disappointed with the response of many secularists to this argument, in particular Michael Shermer. There are many classic responses

1. Question the premise:
-- How do we know that religious teachings x actually correspond to the will of God?
2. Does might make right?
-- Just because God says something is wrong, does that make it right?
Euthyphro dilemma

The Christian apologists argue that God's will is moral, but there is no firm foundation for the belief that God must be moral.

The first stage of the argument lays the groundwork about whatÂ is. It consists of a series of fairly non controversial statements about our world as science has so far illuminated it:

1. Human consciousness, thoughts, and feelings are all grounded in molecules, subatomic particles, fields, and possibly other entities which are capable of being studied scientifically. If some aspect of consciousness (for instance, an eternal soul) were not so, then they could not interact with the world and would be a mere epiphenomenon. As soon as something becomes capable of interacting with objects (causing change), it becomes a possible subject of scientific study. In brief, we reject traditional dualism, taking on a naturalistic view.

2. Members of Homo Sapiens have certain feelings of pleasure, distaste, approval, and disapproval in response to what they perceive through their senses. While many of these feelings are due to cultural conditioning, some are innate. The innateness of moral emotions has been found in many experiments.

3. Moral emotions thus come to us through one of two processes - genes and culture. The genes any one person has, while always at the behest of random factors, have largely been derived from a long process of evolution. Likewise culture, while constantly shifting and changing, has also been built up over millennia, through what might be called cultural evolution.

4. The moral emotions given to us by evolution are generally such that they promote the survival and reproduction of an organism and other organisms with similar genes.

5. Similarly, cultural memes which are successful are those which promote the survival and reproduction of human beings.

The conclusion is:

6. Feelings come from natural causes. These causes can be seperated into two categories - evolution (genes) and culture (memes).

Now we make an value statement:

6. We accept that the surviving and flourishing of human beings is good. [This can be made much more precise, but I don't feel like I need to do so here. The point is, we have made a moral claim here.]

We now make the following contentious claim:

7. The moral emotions given to us by evolution and culture in some average sense help achieve value 6. Some examples are in order:
---- I feel
----

Shermer comes close to achieving this. Note that solving the is-ought problem is not necessary.

There is a push today to create a scienced based system of morality. In my view, this push is misguided.
