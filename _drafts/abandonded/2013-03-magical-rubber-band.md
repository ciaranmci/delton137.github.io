I have generally made a point of not weighing in much on contemporary cultural issues surrounding gender and sexuality. I have opinions on such issues, but quite honestly I don’t have good very arguments for them, so in so much as I like to weigh in publicly,  I would weigh in on economic policy issues or consumer issues.

Of course I find gender and sexuality interesting (who doesn’t), but they are extremely complex things that I am not very knowledgeable in.

Most of my opinions are pretty much the mainstream liberal views - I have no problem with LGBT people, no problem with people changing their gender and I support of disbanding a lot of the traditional gender roles to give people more freedom. It definitely bothers me we teach our children that they must conform to certain gender roles just because of their sex at birth.  I find these views jive well with my other views and overall world view, but quite honestly I do not have very sound arguments to back them up.

In this post I’m not trying to make any type of statement about anything or advocate for any particular shifting of gender roles, merely I would like to account an experiment I did.

Men’s gender roles are more strict than womens.

A contemporary psychology textbook I read for an online course said that boy’s gender roles are actually more strict than girls in contemporary society. This can be seen by considering that a tomboys are generally accepted but the male equivlanet (a girly boy) is considered weak. This has to do with the gender binary
