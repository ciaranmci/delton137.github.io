If you're reading this book, then likely you are at the beginning stages of your Ph.D. career. I remember well how I felt, how I thought, and the kind of person I was when I started my Ph.D. The summer before my Ph.D. started I spent my days doing an internship in the sleepy town of Los Alamos, New Mexico. My days consisted of leisurely rides on the bus into work followed by a few hours of Matlab coding interspersed with a lunch break at the lab cafeteria. In the evenings I went on leisurely strolls through the town, often with a book in hand. In the local cafes, library and parks I read great literature, like Ayn Rand's "Atlas Shrugged", and even parts of "Gravities Rainbow" by Thomas Pinchin. Starting my Ph.D., I was a full blooded intellectual. My quest was to understand how the universe worked. I knew I wasn't cut out for string theory, and I had convinced myself that was a dead end in any case. So I had my sites set on quantum computing. I thought that the nacient science of quantum information theory could provide a new method of understanding the universe. For me, the quantum measurement problem and understanding consciousness were more interesting and deeper questions than how to unify gravity with quantum mechanics.  

Entering the Ph.D. I was was "young, starry eyed and bushy tailed". When I left the Ph.D. almost seven years later I was crippled with anxiety, depression, and almost unbearable loneliness. I was suffering from PTSD, charged with a felony, and $12,000 underwater in legal fees. My mind was cognitively shattered, and I was incapable of focusing more than five minutes on any given task.

You might be wondering what good it will do to read about all the bad things that can happen during the Ph.D. Perhaps you are already thinking this book isn't for you. You might be wondering what good it is to listen to someone who is hopelessly jaded and biased because of their experience. You might be thinking of putting this book back on the shelf and picking up a more conventional book filled with tips and tricks on how to "rock" at the Ph.D., how to write a thesis, and how to succeed as a young researcher.

It is true that I am biased against the Ph.D., based on my personal experience of it. Furthermore, many of my friends had terrible Ph.D. experiences. However, I still believe Ph.D can be an extremely rewarding experience.

But I believe it is also true that the downside risks of the Ph.D. are quite a bit larger than the upsides.

Many people go into the Ph.D. because. However, in most cases, the Ph.D. is not like that. Instead, you will be buffeted. Just like setting a stop loss order can help save your money if the market crashes, a little preperation can help prevent the worst downsides of the Ph.D.

First, consider the mental health risks. I subscribe to a view called negative utilitarianism, which suggests that the possible levels of 0

This book will not be entirely about mitigating the downside risk of the Ph.D. I will also have some positive things to say about how to succeed and how to "kick ass" as a researcher.

However, as someone who was trained as a scientist, I've learned to see past bias. For a long time, I was hesitant to write this account, in part because I felt it would be too biased.

Why are you doing a Ph.D.?

The first thing we need to address. My intent here is not to convince you the Ph.D. is a bad idea. Instead,

Studies show that setting goals.

There is a psychosocial dimension to this as well. For instance most successful startups that I've seen have a snack area for their coders. This may seem. However it serves a useful purpose - it shows the coders are respected. It is a way of the management saying "hey, I value your contributions" so I will provide you with all I can so you can be the most happy and productive while you are working here.

One of the most stressful aspects of graduate school, rarely acknowledged is that you are literally at the bottom of the social hierarchy. This is frustrating given that graduate students are usually highly skilled, and in most organizations highly skilled people are. When I was at Stony Brook I was looked down upon for complaining about the poor office conditions there. One time I got into a confrontation with the building manager --
