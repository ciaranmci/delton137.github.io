The philosophy of Machine Learning.

# Is data science science?

The demarcation problem is an age old problem - how do we distinguish science from non science. We've all heard one solution to this problem, likely  in a science class in middle school or early High School - science follows the scientific method. Yet not all science follows the scientific method.  The best solution to this problem that I've seen is -------

So Data Science is science. Yet  it is science of a very shallow sort.


Machine learning models, however, don't generalize much more.

# Causation

Causality is a fundamental notion which is central to scientific explanation. One way distinguishing machine learning models from physics models is that machine learning only deals with correlations, while physics models have a notion of causation in them. Machine learning might tell you that the presence of the sun is correlated with higher surface temperatures, but physics explains why.  

Yet what counts as a causual mechanism in physics? Taking the example of the sun-surface temperature correlation, the physics explanation is that nuclear fusion in the sun causes the emission of photons, which travel to the Earth and cause things to be heated up. But how do we link up each item in the casual chain?  

 In other words, give a physicist some data, and they are generally interested in a causal expalanation of the data. A machine learning engineer, on the other hand, it more interested in correlations between data and extracting insights. Insights can help physicsits understand the mechanism that produced the data. For instance, a clustering algorithm might indicate that data falls into three categories. A physicist might use this to show that these categories correspond to three different experimental conditions , for instance morning, mid-day, and evening. Or they might indicate discrete configurations of a device or an atom in a system. Clustering has been use to analyze spectral data at different temperatures and pressures to construct phase diagrams.

# Is the end of science near?
People generally fall into three categories, depending on where they are. Traditional academics seem to often view machine learning as an ignoble challenger to physics models. Machine learning engineers, on the other hand, view physics models as overly clunky and impractical to apply. This issue is complex and multifaceted and rarely discussed for fear of offending the other side. Many professors of physics are realists - they think  physics theories actually get at a the fundamental way the universe works, while machine learning is just curve fitting. Now, no physicist would say that our best physical theories are actually how the world works - we know our theories are incomplete and the two pillars of physics (general relativity and the Standard Model of quantum field theory) are inconsistent with each other. Rather, physics realists believe that each successive improvement to physics theory gets us incrementally closer to the true nature of reality. While this view is controversial, I believe it is roughtly correct.







Superficially, science and machine learning seem similar. Both use equations, and both make predictions about things.

In my work, I apply machine learning to a problem that has traditionally been handled by science.

Predicting the sensitivity of a material is very complex. For instance, flat molecules are less sensitive.

Aristotle thought that heavier objects fall faster
