Interesting article because they discuss possible agents to allow for "cognitive remission" in patients with MDD.
"Interventions that target multiple neurochemical systems simultaneously (e.g. SNRIs) might be more likely to improve cognitive performance than treatments targeting only a single system (e.g. SSRIs) [68]. For instance, a trial including adults with MDD treated with escitalopram (SSRI; n = 36) or duloxetine (SNRI; n = 37) for 24 weeks showed that SNRIs were superior to SSRIs in ameliorating memory performance"
