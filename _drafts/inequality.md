A lot of people  worry about current day inequality, but I think sometimes they miss the bigger picture of the transformations that neoliberalism has brought and continues to bring to our world. As an 'ism', neoliberalism is often used by those who attack it. Other mostly synonomous terms are "classical liberalism" and the  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Consensus">Washington Consensus</a>. The two greatest classical liberal theorists were Hayek &amp; Freedman.  They both advocated for things like a minimum.

Neoliberalism advocates for things like constitutionally limited government with democratically elected officials, central banks that target inflation at a steady 2%, a well regulated financial sector, robust property rights, low tariffs, and low regulation. It is not "wild west" free markets of the type that are often advocated by American libertarians and anarcho capitalists. Both Hayek &amp; Mises both believed  in
<strong>The highly misleading crap</strong>
Many of the figures and memes which circulate on the internet are highly misleading because they define wealth in terms of savings (cash/stock). This neglects the majority of the US middle class who have a high standard of living but are financially in debt. As some have noted, if you have any net savings you are "wealthier" than something like 50% of Americans. The change in inequality over time also depends on whether one is talking about "households", since household size as decreased, so household measure exaggerate the increase. Still, it is clear that inequality in the US has increased in the past few decades, with the richest .1% seeing enormous gains relative to the average american, especially since 2008.

<strong>Global inequality vs in-country inequality
</strong>At the same time, however, global inequality is still falling. This is best described in Max Roser's excellent article:

I have attached the most salient graph. Interestingly, his charts also show that by some measures inequality was just as high in European countries in 1900 as it is today. This conflicts that view that under neoliberalism inequality inexorably increases.

Tyler Cowen also wrote about decreasing global inequality in the NY Times:

Similarly, many people focus on the fact that middle class wages have been stagnant or even slightly declining over the past 2 decades, but neglect the fact that many goods &amp; services have decreased in price, and standards of living have risen over the last 40-50 years due to technology.

Finally, the World Economic Forum has discussed how the introduction of technology in Africa is related to both rapid increases in inequality and dramatic reductions in poverty.

I shouldn't have to point this out, but increasing inequality does not necessarily mean that the poor are getting poorer. The economy is not a fixed pie.

As a slight tangent, transhumanists often worry that if inequality gets too high, it could cause great social unrest. This is an old idea that's been around for a while, but it's never really been rigorously justified:

I am not advocating that we turn a blind eye to inequality within countries, or ignore potential problems inequality might cause, or neglect the un-democratic influence of the 1% on the US political system, which exerts influence on government policy to benefit the richest and big corporation. I am merely stating that we need to keep the bigger picture in mind as well and recognize that this is a very complex topic.
