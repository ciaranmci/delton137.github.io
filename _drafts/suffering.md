Brian Tomasik [states](http://reducing-suffering.org/on-the-seriousness-of-suffering/)  "I would rather be depressed for months or years rather than burn at the stake for one minute."

AQ test:  33 out of a possible 50.

Scores in the 33-50 range indicate significant Austistic traits (Autism).

I wonder if Tomasik has read "Mans Search for Meaning".

The thing about pain is that it strikes at a visceral level.



I think Tomasik misunderstands the nature of pain vs suffering. Certainly pain is bad - we avoid it.

One of the worst forms of suffering may be waking up during a surgery. About 0.01% of the US population wakes up during a surgery every year.


Consider child birth, for instance. By all accounts, it is very painful and unpleasant.

## The asymmetry

Jeff McMahan has introduced "the assymmetry" - we consider it wrong to create suffering but OK to fail to create happiness.


One of the things about mental health is that there are so many levels of suffering.

For instance the first time I was depressed was in my senior year of college. There was a girl I had fallen in love with and one of my friends started dating her. At the same time I was struggling in the math class advanced analysis. After bawling my eyes out for a few days  (literally) I went to a therapist and he told me 1. it's natural for me to feel sad given that I was in love, and that the sadness of lost / unrequited love will go away and 2. drop the analysis class.

Then I suffered for from low grade depression in graduate school and later as a postdoc. In the spring of 2018 I had a lot of anhedonia and in summer of 2018 I was quite depressed. However in retrospect those depressions don't feel so bad compared to what hit me in the spring of 2019.
