>"Pain is inevitable; suffering is optional.""
> Haruki Murakami, *What I Talk About When I Talk About Running*


Brian Tomasik [states](http://reducing-suffering.org/on-the-seriousness-of-suffering/)  "I would rather be depressed for months or years rather than burn at the stake for one minute."

AQ test:  33 out of a possible 50.

Scores in the 33-50 range indicate significant Austistic traits (Autism).

I wonder if Tomasik has read "Mans Search for Meaning".

The thing about pain is that it strikes at a visceral level.



I think Tomasik misunderstands the nature of pain vs suffering. Certainly pain is bad - we avoid it.

One of the worst forms of suffering may be waking up during a surgery. About 0.01% of the US population wakes up during a surgery every year.


Consider child birth, for instance. By all accounts, it is very painful and unpleasant.

## The asymmetry

Jeff McMahan has introduced "the assymmetry" - we consider it wrong to create suffering but OK to fail to create happiness.
