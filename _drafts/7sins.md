1. Thinking That AI Doesn't Exist (see: Steve Mnuchin)

2. Conflating AI and Robotics

3. Invoking Terminator

4. Anthropomorphizing AI

5. Citing Asimov's Laws of Robotics as a serious AI safety measure

6. Thinking AI Will Solve All of Our Problems

7. Thinking about AI Solely in Domestic Terms and Ignoring International Aspects
(Open to change on the order)
Basically, the idea would be to explain in simple, easy-to-understand language why each of these sins is a sin, and to offer alternative modes of thinking (not alternative facts, haha).


AI will sudently decide to "become bad"


Thinking that we need to understand how the human brain works beforehand
A lot of people are likely skeptical about AGI by virtue of the fact that we hardly understand how the human brain works.



Just because something is intelliggient doesnt mean its moral


why we should be worried about AI:

General intelligence is a real thing (G factor , etc. )

Nate Soares:
The idea of AI developing malevolent goals *on its own* (hollywood style) is bunk.
well intentioned people often do things with unintended consequences right now.
WHat if you had a black box that was a very powerful optimizer? What would you do with it?

# Joanna Bryson

computation is a physical process
spectacular recent AI successes exploit the discoveries of evolution of culture

quantum computing -- energy cost

Omniscience is not a threat

confusion for moral status of AI :

thermostat is intelligent

cooperation is as natural as competition
