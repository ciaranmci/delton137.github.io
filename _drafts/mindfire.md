On may - , 36 talents gathered in Davos, Switzerland under the premise of "cracking the mind code". This was the first mission of the MindFire foundation, a new Swiss initiative to push towards human level artificial intelligence.

The goal of human level AI is as old as the field of AI itself. It is an admirable goal, and one that really excites and motivates people. It is similar to the goal upon which DeepMind was founded - "to solve intelligence".  However, it is a goal which I believe is a chimera. What do we mean by "human level" -- if we simply mean human level intelligence, this will be hard to achieve given that it will be running on elecrical devices that send signals and switch thousands of times faster than neurons. It would be very easy to modify a human-level AI to have superhuman memory and many other things. The modification might even be done by the AI itself. More generally if it is possible to increase the capabilities of AIs, it will be done -- the economic incentive to do so is clear. After all, we already have lots of humans around, and many important problems we are struggling to solve (aging, cancer & disease, countering the threat of bioterrorism, green energy, ending animal suffering, and AI safety). More human level intelligences might be able to help us with chores (when embodied), but they won't help us address such problems. The speed of takeoff is debatable, but human level AI, when it is achieved, will quickly be supplanted by superhuman AI. The spectre of superhuman AI raises a number of very important , as outlined in the very good book *Superintelligence* by Nick Bostrom.

# Cross disciplinary collaboration -- how far can it go?
For me, MindFire was mostly a lesson in cross-disciplinary collaboration. I did pick learn a few really interesting tidbits about neuroscience and machine learning (did you know that prions are responsible for storing memories in the brain?), but only a few.

Finding and maintaining a shared vision is important. While it is great to get a free trip to Switzerland, taking time out from one's job to make such an excursion is burdensome for most. I got the impression most of the people there applied and decided to go to MindFire after being accepted because they we were inspired by the ambitious goal Pascal set out.

Intelligence:

-- "Anything that takes inputs, computes, and produces outputs" : this was a shockingly bad definition that was proposed.

"cracking the brain code" all meant something slightly different. Here's a few of the ways people understood it:

-- Understanding the "language of the brain", and framing it as understanding a foreign language.
--

It is similar to the question of how to define information.

However, I brought up the issue of defining "the brain code" on the last day, when I was sitting at a table with 7 other people. I defined the brain code as definition 1. One person said they disagreed with it, and their tone of voice suggested strong disagreement, but it seemed like they didn't want to spend time hashing out the disagreement at that moment. Everyone else seemed ambivalent or not willing to voice their opinion, and the discussion moved on.

<!-- Personally, MindFire was a time when I was fully present. My neurons felt really activated. -->

# Some ideas...

In the early 1990s, Elon Musk identified three key technologies that were immediately on the horizon - the Internet (and electronic payments), green energy, and cheaper access to space. Three technologies which now loom on the horizon are quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and nanotechnology.

Let me first define what I mean by these terms:

*Quantum computing* - computing that uses quantum effects to achieve speedups not possible on classical computing. This includes quantum simulation, which is using a quantum system to simulate a different quantum system.

*Artificial intelligence* - intelligence, by one definition, is the ability to predict. Most AI today is narrow -- for instance a pocket calculator can predict the outcome of an arithmetic calculation, or alphaGo can predict how to win a Go game.

*nanotechnology* -  


There are significant synergies between these technologies.

Quantum <=> nanotech

Quantum computing can take the form of quantum simulation, or simulating a quantum system using a quantum system. In fact, this was the application of quantum computing that Richard Feynman had in mind in his famous talk "There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom". Currently quantum simulations use approximate methods (such as density functional theory) and require large supercomputers. Cheap quantum simulation would enable what Alan Aspuru-Guzik calls "the matter simulation revolution". Part of this would be

One the other hand, if nanotech is developed first.


Several possible development trajectories can be distinguished, depending which technology comes first. If

It will allow for a new era of matter simulation, greatly accelerating the discovery of new drugs and materials. Quantum machine learning will be an enabler of AI, making it possible to train very deep neural models. Eventually, however, AI systems will run on custom hardware which is a mix of classical and quantum devices. Artificial intelligence and quantum simulation will make it possible to build nanoscale assemblers of the type envisioned by Eric Drexler. These assemblers will be able to assemble virtually any material good down to atomistic precision. Thus, in 2118 it will be possible to alleviate all poverty. There will be little need for specialization of labor, except in special cases, so it will be possible for the vast majority of people to be generalists, unless they otherwise choose. Thus it will be possible to realize "post capitalism" in some form. Capitalist economics will persist in the machine world, however, as the price mechanism is used to coordinate the use of a few scarce resources that still exist (such as the time of key individuals / AIs,  antiquities, and high-value human made products).

Artificial intelligence will be vastly more intelligent than humans, but it will be possible for cyborgs (humans with significant non-biological computing hardware) to compete. It will be possible for self replicating AI probes to start colonizing the galaxy, leading to competition for galactic resources between cyborgs (humanity) and other "complete AIs" which are considered non human.  It will be possible for individuals to have their connectome uploaded, but the captured representation will have some flaws due an inability to capture molecular details of synapses and possible quantum information processing at the cellular level. Therefore "uploading" the brain phyiscally into non-biological hardware will be preferred (ie. a "brain in a vat"). It will be possible therefore to live in a robotic body which can survive in outerspace and has a lifespan of thousands of year. Most people will complete such a transition gradually over several decades of development. It will possible to be a transhumanist without stigma, and cyborgs will be highly respected and the natural leaders of human society. Women will be able to use artificial wombs to have children, and genetic engineer them to have certain traits. Human memory enhancements and telepathic communication will be standard hardware. It will be possible to receive a complete Ph.D. level education in milliseconds by uploading data into exocortex hardware although it will take it longer for it to "penetrate" into the legacy biological brain. The source of self will shift into non-biological hardware, although individuals will find it hard to shed their nonbiological part completely. It will be possible to travel to mars. Interstellar travel will also be possible, but only through cryogentic 'sleeper ships' which cruise for thousands of years in interstellar space.
