check logs - was I lonely during my senior year of college
---
For a long time, I lived by myself without feeling that lonely. In my senior year of college, for instance, I was a complete closet case. I think I drowned out that loneliness by masturbating to porn and chatting with random people on Omegle.

While I was always quite a bit of a "loner" growing up, it wasn't until my 2nd year of graduate school that my serious struggles with loneliness began. Since then I am still lonely quite often but in this blog I hope to share some methods for reducing loneliness.

## Chronic loneliness and depression
At some point, the loneliness got into what I think of as "chronic" territory. In this phase, the loneliness of past became a burden which I constantly carried. Random thoughts and things in my environment would elicit painful memories. For instance, when I was going to chipotle I would think about how I've been going to Chipotle by myself for so long, and how I used to sit outside Cabo Fresh as a graduate student all by myself and feel lonely and sad. It was difficult to go running, because it would trigger memories of loneliness.

Another example is thinking of coffee and then thinking of the coffee they gave us at the graduate school orientation, and then thinking about how I used to get angry because the building at Stony Brook sucked so much.

# Social Connection
Caitlin Krause [says](https://pinkpangea.com/2016/10/caitlinkrause/)
"I think being in environments that are filled with different languages and backgrounds makes me even more aware of the similarities and human connections. "

This sounds like a paradox. I don't believe everyone responds the way Caitlin does. By being around people who are very different, we have a choice - we hunker down and become lonely, or we open ourselves up to being vulnerable by searching for commonalities.

This article is about how to reduce loneliness. Most articles on the subject start by drawing the distinction between social isolation and loneliness. Social isolation is not having many people physically around or in close contact (ie. via electronic devices) whereas loneliness is a feeling or perception of being disconnected from other people. Loneliness is a very unpleasant feeling which strikes us at our core and can lead to physical effects such as elevated stress levels, chest pain, and tension. Declared that loneliness is the public health crisis of our time.

One can be socially isolated and not feel lonely and one can be lonely while being surronded by people and having many friends. Most articles I've seen on the subject conclude from this distinction that loneliness is therefore "all in one's head". According to this line of thinking, loneliness is a symptom of either not being comfortable with oneself or being overly needy and not independent enough. While these factors are the cause of loneliness for many people, there are deeper causes. Neither of these causes applied to me, which is my main motivation for writing this article.

Let's dispose with neediness first. One author talks about how he struggled with loneliness after going on a business trip for one week. If you get lonely after being apart from your loved ones for one week, then you are needy, and this article is not for you - you do need to learn how to be more independent. This article is for very independent people who struggle with loneliness. In fact, in my experience extreme independence is in fact a cause of loneliness -- so too much of "the cure" can bring back the disease. Loneliness can and does hit people who love themselves unconditionally, are strong and independent. There are several ways this can happen:

* People who are not neurotypical or and can't find like-minded people to connect with. This includes people on the autistic spectrum, people with cognitive impairments, transgender people, and people with genetic diseases that effect them physically and/or mentally in unusual ways.
* People who live in a foreign culture (for instance an American living in a small Japanese town)
* People who hold very hetereodox philosophical and ethical beliefs which makes it hard for them to fit in.
* People who have suffered a series of unfortunate events, such as close friends moving away, loosing a SO and then realizing you don't have any other friends, or having to move to a foriegn place and finding it hard to connect to people.

If you fall into any of the above categories and suffer from loneliness, this article is for you.

In such cases,  a person can simply "think their way out of loneliness". Instead, one has to build social connections.

# Palliative care
The first thing one should do is implement several palliative measures. I call these palliative because they don't truly solve the underlying causes of loneliness, but they get you mentally in a place where you can more easily solve them. In cases of the chronic loneliness, as I suffered from, there is typically comorbid depression, which makes one less functional. Note that depression doesn't usually manifest itself in just "feeling sad". In my case, I had cognitive issues (brain fog), increased neuroticism & anxiety, chronic lack of appetite and below optimal nutritional intake, lowered motivation, fatigue, and mild anhedonia (inability to feel pleasure). If your loneliness has comorbid depression, anxiety, or physical symptoms, then the first thing you should do is start seeing a psychologist. Having a nonjudgemental person you can talk to on a weekly or even biweekly basis is immensely valuable.

It will likely be hard to discuss your loneliness with your psychologist due to the social taboos associated with the subject and the pain discussing it will bring up. With the first psychologist I saw, while I often told him I was struggling with loneliness, I was not able to discuss my loneliness with him for the entire year that I met with him. As soon as we brushed on discussing what I really felt, I would feel tears welling up and sometimes I would start crying. It was too painful to discuss. In retrospect, that psychologist was young and not very good. Learning how to guide a patient to confront their issues, but *in a nonjudgemental way* takes a lot of training and experience. This is why I suggest seeking out an older psychologist -- the craft of good psychotherapy is something learned over decades. A good psychologist will make you confront the loneliness and pain you have deep inside and get you to open up about your weaknesses. The process of letting your defenses down and opening up is slow and plays out over months, not weeks. The best psychologist I ever had said that (good) psychotherapy is like chemotherapy. Expect to feel worse before you feel better -- and recognize that if you feel worse, that's OK -- it's part of the process.

The next thing one should do is be socially active. I found contra dance to be remarkably helpful in this regard.

The final thing is to get a pet, if you can.

# Confronting the cause
After implementing palliative measures, you should be functional enough to tackle the root cause. The root cause of loneliness is not having deep, meaningful connections and feeling needed.

There are many studies backing this up:

Touch is vital, and touch deprevation is a real thing. Dance plays a very important social function in this regard, by providing a venue where it is socially acceptable to touch strangers. The joy of holding hands, of a warm embrace, of being in temporal and emotional sync with another human being can all be experienced through dance.

 Close connections are rare in life, and should be treasured.

Feeling needed

If you are like me, you may have a lot of trouble getting close to people from other cultures or socioecnomic backgrounds. As many, I was taught in middle school that diversity is always a virtue, and I believed it was important that I try to connect with people from other cultures to learn from them. While it is true that diversity has many benefits, and also true that we all share a common humanity despite our diversity, for many it is much harder to get close to people who are very different. For years in graduate school I hung out with people who were very different from me, and I felt terrible that I couldn't connect. I felt immennsely ashamed that the only people I could connect with were uniformly white, middle class, raised Christian, and from rural areas. Whenever I was hanging out with people who were different there was always an awkwardness, and a distance that I didn't know how to bridge. My own high level of baseline anxiety contributed enormously to my trouble bridging such gaps. I would worry non native English speakers might not get what I was saying, that they might not understand a turn of phrase, that they might be offended if I dumbed down my wording. I worried about offending northern Europeans with my brash American impoliteness, and worried about offending southern Europeans and latin Americans and with my strict Protestant, (perhaps even Puritanical) values that had been drilled deep inside me through my upbringing. I worried constantly about offending people. So I was always on guard about what I was saying and I was unable to engage in dialogue when others said things about the United States and Americans that I disagreed with.

I'm not saying it is always hard to get close to people from other cultures. Although it was hard for me, some people are better at it. There should also be a recognition of common humanity, and the things that bind everyone together - birth, childhood, food, life, work, illness, and death. There are many human universals. Equally important though, is that one recognize and respect differences, coupled with a willingness to explore them for the mutual benefit of both parties. Sadly, in our era of identity politics, political correctness, and outrage culture, discussing cultural differences, even at the individual level, doing so become very awkward and difficult.

Given the seriousness of chronic loneliness and because it takes a long time to cure, following the path of least resistance is probably a good idea. This often means connecting with people who are similar to you first before attempting to get close to people who are not. This is naturally what happens (see self segregation). Meetups tend to develop along social and ethnic lines. Contra dance and swing dance are almost entirely white Americans, for instance, while --- attracts mostly African americans. Many people think these behavior are due to racism, the belief that other races are inferior in some way. While racism plays a role, I don't think it is the primary driver of self segregation. Rather, people's need to form deep social connections drives them in that direction.  It is harder to form a deep social connection with someone from a different culture. Of course, there are major problems with self segregation - it cements inequality, and racism and xenophobia tend to grow in homogeneous societies. Studies show diverse teams are more creative. However there are also benefits - it is easier to connect to people, and studies show homogeneous societies have less crime, are more politically and socially progressive, and most importantly that people are more trusting in homogeneous societies. The point here, though, is not to wade into a debate about the virtues and problems associated with diversity and multiculturalism. Rather, it is to recognize that self segregation is at least in part, good, and nothing to be ashamed of contributing to. Just make sure to critically evaluate yourself and root out any racism or xenophobia inside yourself that you detect influencing your decision making.  

The next thing one can do, which can be very helpful to many people is to  developing a connection with God or some other form of spirituality. Many studies show that belief in a personal god...

Practices like meditation, while difficult and time consuming, can help reduce suffering which comes from the desire for connection by allowing you to disconnect a bit from your feelings and emotions. Meditation and mindfullness won't make loneliness go away, but it can help you learn how to recover quicker and not get sucked into a negative cycle when they arise.

## Directed mindfulness: repeat this mantra

* Place yourself in public places -- this advice is repeated all over the interwebs. It sounds like advice by someone who has no experience with loneliness. There are common failure modes to this advice which completely backfire. The biggest for me had to do with public displays of affection (PDAs). PDAs, in my experience, can exacerbate loneliness, which is why if you are in a relationship you may not want think twice about PDAs. Nobody likes to be reminded of what you don't have. Furthermore, the cultural atmosphere of the environment can also ex

The second failure mode is that differences can become more apparent when someone emerses themselves in broader society. This is worsened by the fact that most cities in the United States are now multicultural. While it is great that vastly different cultures can live side by side today (as opposed to the historical norm of constantly fighting each other), an unfortunate side effect of this is that during mindfulness you will notice how different many people are from you. This excacerbates feelings of loneliness and social disconnection. That's why its important to nudge the awareness-enhancing effect of mindfulness so that you become more aware of similarities, rather than differences. The important point here is to acknowledge the differences. Refusal acknowledge differences currently leads to a lot of weird pathologies in our public discourse, including political correctness.

Repeat this mantra over and over : "We are different, but we are also all the same". acknowledge differences, but refocus your attention on our common humanity.
