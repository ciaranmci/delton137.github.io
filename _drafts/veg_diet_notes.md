Omnivores had the lowest intake of Mg, vitamin C, vitamin E, niacin and folic acid. Vegans reported low intakes of Ca and a marginal consumption of the vitamins D and B12. The highest prevalence for vitamin and mineral deficiencies in each group was as follows: in the omnivorous group, for folic acid (58 %); in the vegetarian group, for vitamin B6 and niacin (58 and 34 %, respectively); and in the vegan group, for Zn (47 %)



2. Soy protein sources can cause hormone disruptions, including estrogen and thyroid hormone

. Testosterone levels were evaluated in a meta-analysis of 32 reports with no conclusive interaction between soy or isoflavone intake and free testosterone concentrations
Clinical studies show no effects of soy protein or isoflavones on reproductive hormones in men: results of a meta-analysis.

In epidemiological studies, Asian traditional diets rich in phytoestrogens were linked to lower risks of coronary heart disease [230,252,253,254] and there are some evidence on possible benefit in hormone-dependent prostate [255,256,257], colon, breast [258,259,260,261,262] and ovarian cancers [263,264,265], menopausal symptoms [266,267], osteoporosis [268,269,270,271,272], obesity [273], cognitive dysfunctions [274] and overall risk reduction for non-communicable diseases [109,263,264,275]. Though estrogenic potency of isoflavones was weaker in relation to 17Î²-estradiol [276], circulating isoflavone levels may exceed endogenous estradiol concentrations in subjects with diet rich in soy foods [126,277].

The debate on the potential perturbation on sex hormones network by phytoestrogens specially pertains infants fed soy-based formula [81] and the putative consequences of massive introduction early in life [278,279]. Moreover, dietary soy intake has been associated with increased risk of thyroid disorders [280], bladder cancer incidence [281], dementia [282] and breast cell proliferation [283,284].
 mentia reference doesn't mention soy!!

 fish and vegetables correlated with low depression
