This is the personal webpage and blog of Daniel C. Elton.

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Maryland, College Park, where I work in the Mechanical Engineering department with Prof. [Peter W. Chung](http://blog.umd.edu/crstl/) on applying machine learning to materials property prediction and molecular design.
