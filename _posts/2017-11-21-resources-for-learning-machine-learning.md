Recently a few people have asked me for the best courseware for learning machine learning. The truth is there is no simple answer. Certainly the machine learning course by Andrew Ng is a good place to start, but most people I know are looking for more depth. Here are some resources I've collected. This list will be expanded and refined over time:

# Select online courses for machine learning
Coursera: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning">“Machine Learning” - Andrew Ng</a> (the most popular)

Coursera: “<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks">Neural Networks for Machine Learning</a>” - Geoffrey Hinton (for a deep dive)

Lectures for course on [reinforcement learning](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B-WvrETGtkesN29sV1g3aXZ1Z0U).

The are a gazillion other data science / machine learning online courses. Many of them are very short there or only superficially introduce topics and show you barebones implementations. [Someone reviewed a large number of them here](http://www.skilledup.com/articles/list-data-science-bootcamps)
