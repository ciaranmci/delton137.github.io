<span style="font-family:Verdana;"><b>Here&#8217;s some rankings of energy drinks based onmy personal experience. See my previous post: <a href="https://moreisdifferent.wordpress.com/2010/07/01/energy-drink-ingredients-do-they-work-a-science-based-review/">Energy drink ingredients – do they work? A science-based review</a><br /> </b></span><!--more-->

 <span style="font-family:Verdana;"><b><span style="font-size:large;">Monster Java</span></b><br /> <b>Taste:</b> Pretty good for beverages of this type. Strong coffee taste.<br /> <b>Energy:</b> good<b><br /> </b><br /> <b><span style="font-size:large;">Monster Khaos :</span><br /> Taste:</b> poor!<br /> <b>Energy:</b> seemed like a quick &#8220;taurine&#8221; buzz. moderate caffeine buzz.<br /> <b>Ingredients:</b> Too much taurine. A bit too much sugar. Too many B vitamins.</span>

 **<span style="font-size:large;">AMP </span>**

**Taste:** tastes like a bit more punchy mountain dew.

**Energy:** depends on sugar tolerance / how fast you drink. Expect a crash if drunk too quickly.

**Ingredients:** pretty good.. WAY too much sugar. (>60g / can).

**<span style="font-size:large;">GURU</span>

** GURU is an &#8220;organic&#8221; energy drink.

**Taste:** tastes ok, pretty strong sticky-sweet flavor with a lot of white grape juice concentrate. Also has light carbonation.

**Energy:** packs 125mg of caffeine and a lot of guarana. For sweetening it uses a mixture of cane sugar and with stevia and contains 22g of sugar alcohols. This is all concentrated in 8.3oz, so you probably want to drink slowly.

**Ingredients:** the ingredients are the real selling point. It has no taurine, and is mostly guarana. Contains 125mg of guarana-derived caffeine.  It also contains a handful of herbs including gingko biobia and some others that probably don&#8217;t do much. It also contains luo han guo fruit extract, mentioned above, which doubles as a sweetener as well. The downside of this drink is the high price (~$2.50).

<span style="font-size:large;"><br /> </span> **<span style="font-size:large;">Sugar free AMP</span>

Taste:** tastes like watered-down mountain dew. Crisper, lower viscosity.

**Energy:** caffeine buzz.

**Ingredients:** pretty good.

 <span style="font-family:Verdana;"><b><span style="font-size:large;">Purple Stuff</span></b><br /> Taste: horrible. Tastes like very watered down pepto-bismal with generic “fruit” flavor. Slight metallic taste.<br /> Energy: none. This is actually a “relaxation beverage”. It made me feel woozy. Highly not recommended.<br /> Ingredients: Valarian root, L-Theianine.</span>

 **<span style="font-family:Verdana;"><span style="font-size:large;">Sobe Cirtus Energy</span></span>******

Taste: strong citrus flavor. Very good and sweet.

Energy: packs a lot of energy and a lot of sugar. Best if drunk slowly, due to high sugar content.

Key ingredients: 60+ g. of sugar

**<span style="font-family:Verdana;"><span style="font-size:large;">Starbucks: Doubleshot Energy + Coffee (Mocha flavor)</span></span>

** Taste: pretty good, if you need energy. If you looking for the rich, tingling, aromatic coffee experience you certainly won&#8217;t find it here, or with any caned coffee-flavored beverage. However, the flavor is superior to __ Monster Java, in part due to slightly lower Taurine content.(1800mg per can vs 2000+mg per can)_

_ Key ingredients: Maltodextrin (2000mg), Taurine (1800mg), L-Carnitine (450mg), Inositol (180mg), Panax Ginseng (325mg), Guarana (90mg)._ _
