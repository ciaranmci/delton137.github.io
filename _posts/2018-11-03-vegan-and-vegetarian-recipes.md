# Greek quinoa wraps with tzatziki
---
---
Quinoa component adapted from Two Peas & Their Pod
Makes about 6 wraps

### INGREDIENTS

For the tzatziki:

* 1 medium English cucumber
* 1-1/2 cups nonfat plain yogurt or plain Greek yogurt
* 1 teaspoon lemon juice
* Salt and pepper

For the Quinoa:  

* 2 cups water
* 1 cup dry quinoa, rinsed
* 1 cup chopped peeled cucumber
* 1 cup halved grape tomatoes
* 1/4 cup pre-sliced kalamata olives
* 1/4 cup chopped parsley
* 1/3 cup crumbled low-fat feta cheese
* 3 tablespoons olive oil
* 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
* 1/2 teaspoon sea salt
* 1/4 teaspoon ground pepper
* Optional: Add red onions for more crunch (I just don't like red onions), or chickpeas for more bulk

For the Wraps:  

* 6 twelve grain or whole wheat tortillas
* Romaine lettuce
* Tzatziki (above)
* Greek quinoa (above)

### INSTRUCTIONS

* Prepare the tzatziki: Peel the cucumber, cut it in half lengthwise, and scoop out the seeds.  Grate the flesh into a strainer, sprinkle with salt, and let sit for 20 minutes.  Use your hands or a paper towel to squeeze out as much liquid as you can from the cucumber.
* Add the cucumber to the yogurt.  If you have time, you can strain the yogurt through a cheesecloth for a couple of hours first to drain out some of the water and thicken it, but I don’t bother.  Add lemon juice, mix everything together, and season with salt and pepper to taste.  Keep in refrigerator until ready to use.
* Prepare quinoa: Bring 2 cups of water to a boil in a medium saucepan.  Add quinoa, cover, and reduce to a simmer for 15 minutes.  Remove from heat and keep covered for 5 minutes.  Remove lid, fluff with a fork, and transfer to a large bowl to let cool.
* Meanwhile, mix the cucumber, tomatoes, olives, parsley, and feta together in a medium bowl.  In a separate small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, red wine vinegar, salt and pepper for the dressing.
* Add the cucumber mixture to the quinoa and toss together.  Drizzle the dressing overtop, and mix to coat.  Season with additional salt and pepper if desired.
* Prepare wraps: Lay a lettuce leaf in the center of each wrap.  Top with tzatziki sauce and quinoa, wrap, and serve.

# VegNews' macaroni and cheese
---
---
[Modified by Epicureanvegan](http://epicureanvegan.com/2011/05/28/vegnews-macaroni-and-cheese/)

### INGREDIENTS
* 8-oz elbow macaroni (I used about 10-ounces)
* 4 slices of bread, torn into large pieces (I recommend using two. Four was WAY too much)
* 2 Tbs + ⅓ C Earth Balance margarine (this is one stick)
* 2 Tbs shallots, chopped
* 1 C red potatoes, peeled and chopped (I used one large russet potato)
* ¼ C carrot, chopped|
* ⅓ C onion, chopped
* 1 C water
* ¼ C cashews
* 2 tsp salt (I used 1 tsp)
* ¼ tsp garlic, minced
* ¼ tsp Dijon mustard
* 1 Tbs lemon juice
* ¼ tsp black pepper
* ⅛ tsp cayenne
* ¼ tsp paprika
* Optional: ¼ C nutritional yeast (I threw it in for some extra B vitamins)

### DIRECTIONS
* Preheat oven to 350.
* Place the bread pieces in a food processor with the 2 tablespoons of Earth Balance and process until well crumbly and well combined. I used Rudi's brand and it made so much! I ended up only using maybe half of what it made and even that was too much. I highly recommend using 2 slices of bread with 1 tablespoon of margarine.
*  Cook the pasta according to package instructions.
* In a medium saucepan, combine the potatoes, carrots, onions, and shallots with the water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer and cover for 15 minutes.
* Meanwhile, in a blender or food processor, combine the cashews, salt, garlic, remaining margarine, Dijon, lemon juice, pepper, cayenne, and nutritional yeast, if using. I recommend grinding the cashews up first before adding the rest of the ingredients. Blend until smooth.
* Add the vegetable/water mixture to the cashew mixture and blend it until smooth. You'll end up with a creamy cheesy sauce.
* In a large bowl, combine the sauce and pasta until well coated. Pour it into a 9x13 baking pan.
* Top with the breadcrumbs and sprinkle with paprika.
* Bake for 25-30 minutes and enjoy!

# Hearty black bean quesadillas
---
---
from [Budget Bytes](https://www.budgetbytes.com/hearty-black-bean-quesadillas/)

### INGREDIENTS
* 1 15 oz. can black beans** $0.56
* 1 cup frozen corn kernels $0.48
* 1/2 small red onion $0.44
* 1 clove garlic $0.08
* 1/4 bunch fresh cilantro $0.21
* 2 cups shredded cheese $2.50
* 1 batch taco seasoning $0.34
* 10 taco sized tortillas $2.00

### INSTRUCTIONS
* Drain the can of beans and rinse lightly. Place the beans in a large bowl along with the corn (no need to thaw).
* Rinse the cilantro, remove the leaves, and chop roughly. Dice the onion and mince the garlic. Add the cilantro, onion, garlic, and shredded cheese to the bowl with the beans and corn. Lastly, mix up a batch of taco seasoning and add to the bowl. Stir everything until evenly mixed.
* Place a half cup of the filling on one side of each tortilla and fold over. Cook in a skillet on both sides over medium heat until brown and crispy and the cheesy filling has melted.
* To freeze the quesadillas, simply fill each one and place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Place in the freezer for one hour to solidify the quesadillas and then transfer to a freezer bag. To reheat either microwave (for a soft quesadilla) or cook in a skillet on low heat (make sure to use low heat so that the filling has time to thaw and melt before the outside burns).

# Banana oatmeal chocolate chip muffins

---
---
From [Beaming Baker](https://beamingbaker.com/banana-oatmeal-chocolate-chip-muffins-vegan-gluten-free-dairy-free-refined-sugar-free/)

### Ingredients
* 3 medium, very ripe bananas (1 cup + 2 tablespoons mashed)
* ¼ cup melted coconut oil
* ¼ cup coconut sugar
* ¼ cup pure maple syrup
* 2 flax eggs (2 tablespoons ground flax + 6 tablespoons water, whisk together, set for 15 mins)
* ½ cup unsweetened almond milk, room temperature
* 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
* Dry Ingredients
* 1 ¾ cups gluten free oat flour (how to make gluten free oat flour here)
* 1 ¼ cups gluten free rolled oats
* 1 ½ teaspoons baking powder
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
* ¾ cup vegan chocolate chips

Optional Toppings

* 1 tablespoon gluten free rolled oats
* 2 tablespoons vegan chocolate chips

### Instructions
* Preheat the oven to 325°F degrees. Line a 12-cup muffin pan with muffin liners.
* Peel bananas and add to a large mixing bowl. Using a sturdy whisk or fork, mash bananas until smooth. Add the oil, sugar, maple syrup, flax eggs, milk and vanilla. Whisk until well incorporated.
* Add oat flour, oats, baking powder, baking soda and cinnamon. Whisk together until just incorporated, making sure no flour patches remain. Fold in chocolate chips.
* Using a large scoop, scoop and drop batter evenly into muffin cups. I use this ice cream scoop for easy scooping and a beautiful round top. If not using the scoop, smooth batter into an even layer, with a domed top (rise) in the center. Optionally, press oats and chocolate chips on top of the muffins.
* Bake for 24-30 minutes. Mine took 29 minutes for large domed-topped muffins.
* Allow to cool in muffin pan set on a cooling rack for about 20 minutes. Remove from pan to finish cooling, about 1-2 hours.
