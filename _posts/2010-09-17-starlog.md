|  **Messier Objects**  |  
|  ** **  |  **Other Name(s)**  |  **Type**  |  **Con**  |  **Mag**  |  **First viewed**  |  **Location / Notes**  |  
|  [M1](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m001.html)  |  Crab Nebula, Taurus A  |  P Neb  |  Tau  |  8.4  |   ~8/07  |   Very, very, very, very dim in 6" at RPI.  Remnant of supernova of 1054. This is a somewhat difficult object at RPI, due to being large and diffuse. It is best viewed in the 16", when high in the sky and  fills up a good portion of the 50mm. Rocking the telescope helps.  |  
|  [M2](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m002.html)  |  M2,NGC7089  |  Globular  |  Agr  |  7.5  |   9/3/08  |  Like M3, but might be slightly smaller. Stars along edge barely resolvable in 16"  |  
|  [M3](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m003.html)  |  M3,NGC5272  |  Globular  |  Cvn  |  7  |   ~8/07  |  Similar to M13, but not as big. Like small cotton ball in 6".  |  
|  [M4](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m004.html)  |  Cat's Eye  |  Globular  |  Sco  |  7.5  |     |   |  
|  [M5](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m005.html)  |  M5,NGC5904  |  Globular  |  Ser  |  7  |  8/07  |  Viewed in backyard w/ 6". Like M3 / M13, appears as cotton ball.  |  
|  [M6](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m006.html)  |  Butterfly Cluster  |  Open  |  Sco  |  4.5  |     |   |  
|  [M7](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m007.html)  |  Scorpion's Tail, Ptolemy's Cluster  |  Open  |  Sco  |  3.5  |     |   |  
|  [M8](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m008.html)  |  Lagoon Nebula, Dragon Nebula  |  Open+D Neb  |  Sgr  |  5  |   7/07  |  Adirondack Star Party: easy to spot with 6". Second brightest after Orion in N Hemisphere. Has pretty open cluster in it as well, with "grid" of stars.  |  
|  [M9](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m009.html)  |  M9,NGC6333  |  Globular  |  Oph  |  9  |     |   |  
|  [M10](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m010.html)  |  M10,NGC6254  |  Globular  |  Oph  |  7.5  |     |   |  
|  [M11](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m011.html)  |  Wild Duck Cluster  |  Open  |  Sct  |  7  |     |   |  
|  [M12](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m012.html)  |  Gumball Globular  |  Globular  |  Oph  |  8  |   11/21  |  Nice globular for 16". Outermost stars are apparently just barely visible, although I did not see them.  |  
|  [M13](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m013.html)  |  Hercules Globular Cluster  |  Globular  |  Her  |  7  |   ~4/06  |   One of my most-viewed. Appears as bright cotton ball in 6". Very impressive in 16" as individual stars visible on outer third section. Colors sometimes discernable.  |  
|  [M14](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m014.html)  |  M14,NGC6402  |  Globular  |  Oph  |  9.5  |     |   |  
|  [M15](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m015.html)  |  Great Pegasus Cluster  |  Globular  |  Peg  |  7.5  |   11/07  |  Viewed with 11". Another nice globular, almost as impressive as M13.  |  
|  [M16](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m016.html)  |  Eagle Nebula, The Ghost  |  Open+D Neb  |  Ser  |  6.5  |     |   |  
|  [M17](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m017.html)  |  Omega Nebula, Swan Nebula  |  Open+D Neb  |  Sgr  |  7  |  8/31/07   |  Barely discernable with 16" Cas & 50mm w/ H-alpha filter. Could only see one "wing".    |  
|  [M18](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m018.html)  |  Black Swan  |  Open  |  Sgr  |  8  |     |   |  
|  [M19](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m019.html)  |  M19,NGC6273  |  Globular  |  Oph  |  8.5  |     |   |  
|  [M20](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m020.html)  |  Trifid Nebula, The Clover  |  Open+D Neb  |  Sgr  |  5  |   7/07  |  Rather dim in 6". Lies above Lagoon nebula.  |  
|  [M21](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m021.html)  |  M21,NGC6531  |  Open  |  Sgr  |  7  |     |   |  
|  [M22](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m022.html)  |  Great Sagittarius Cluster  |  Globular  |  Sgr  |  6.5  |     |   |  
|  [M23](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m023.html)  |  M23,NGC6494  |  Open  |  Sgr  |  6  |     |   |  
|  [M24](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m024.html)  |  Small Sagittarius Star Cloud  |  Open  |  Sgr  |  4.5  |     |   |  
|  [M25](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m025.html)  |  M25  |  Open  |  Sgr  |  6.5  |     |   |  
|  [M26](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m026.html)  |  M26,NGC6694  |  Open  |  Sct  |  9.5  |     |   |  
|  [M27](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m027.html)  |  Dumbbell Nebula  aka "The Apple Core"  |  P Neb  |  Vul  |  7.5  |   9/21/07  |  RPI: 16" Cas w/ nebula filter: appears as 2 overlapping patches. Very nice object and one of Dave's favorites.  |  
|  [M28](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m028.html)  |  M28,NGC6626  |  Globular  |  Sgr  |  8.5  |     |   |  
|  [M29](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m029.html)  |  Cooling Tower  |  Open  |  Cyg  |  9  |     |   |  
|  [M30](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m030.html)  |  M30,NGC7099  |  Globular  |  Cap  |  8.5  |     |   |  
|  [M31](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m031.html)  |  Andromeda Galaxy  |  Galaxy  |  And  |  4.3  |   7/07  |   First viewed at ADK Star Party w/ my 6", 32mm. Central bulge fills 16" Cas. May be just possible to see with naked eye under good conditions at RPI. Easy to see under dark skies.  |  
|  [M32](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m032.html)  |  Satellite Of Andromeda Galaxy  |  Galaxy  |  And  |  9.1  |   7/07  |  Appears as star w/ slight nebulosity in 6". Easily discernable in 16" Cas   |  
|  [M33](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m033.html)  |  Triangulum Galaxy, Pinwheel Galaxy  |  Galaxy  |  Tri  |  6.2  |     |   |  
|  [M34](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m034.html)  |  Spiral Cluster  |  Open  |  Per  |  6  |     |   |  
|  [M35](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m035.html)  |  M35,NGC2168  |  Open  |  Gem  |  5.5  |   3/22/09  |  Another excellent open cluster. Starfield fills the entire FOV of the 50mm in the 16". It is nice to compare M35-M38 because they are quite close to each other in the sky. It has over 120 stars brighter than mag 13 and around 500 total, spread over an area the size of the full moon.  |  
|  [M36](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m036.html)  |  Pinwheel Cluster  |  Open  |  Aur  |  6.5  |    2/13/09  |  There are 3 clusters lying fairly close together in Auiga, M36, 37 and 38. This one is the most sparse. It is primarily a few dozen bright stars, perhaps of slightly different hues (yellow-orange). Otherwise, not terribly interesting, and I don't see why its called the pinwheel..  |  
|  [M37](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m037.html)  |  Auriga Salt-and-pepper Cluster  |  Open  |  Aur  |  6  |    2/13/09  |  Very nice open cluster. A rich field of dim stars sprinkled like salt (and pepper?). Fairly large cluster (easily fills 50mm in 16"). Worth seeing in finder scope as well.  |  
|  [M38](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m038.html)  |  Starfish Cluster  |  Open  |  Aur  |  7  |   2/13/09  |  Decent open cluster, quite large, so best viewed in finder scope.  |  
|  [M39](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m039.html)  |  M39,NGC7092  |  Open  |  Cyg  |  5.5  |     |   |  
|  [M40](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m040.html)  |  Winnecke 4  |  Dbl+Asterism  |  Uma  |  8.7  |  2/14/09   |  This object is a rather uninteresting double star as the separation is not very close. It is believed to in fact be an optical double. Measurements show the stars are moving apart, and have moved significantly in the last century. In all likelihood, this was a mistake in Messer's list, he was trying to find a non-existent nebula reported to be near this double. (see link for more info).  |  
|  [M41](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m041.html)  |  Little Beehive  |  Open  |  Cma  |  5  |     |  Basically a smaller Beehive. As the Beehive is a massive cluster, this object is still pretty big, and best viewed through finder scope to get the proper view.  May have been recorded by Aristotle in 325 B.C  |  
|  [M42](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m042.html)  |  Great Orion Nebula, Orion A  |  Open+D Neb  |  Ori  |  4  |   2006?  |  (first viewed w/ naked eye, unknown time)  Best nebula in N. Hemisphere. !!! Trapezium easily seen in 6" and 16" Cas. Texturing and outer diffuse glow visible in 16"  |  
|  [M43](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m043.html)  |  De Mairan's Nebula  |  D Neb  |  Ori  |  9  |   11/21  |  This is basically an extension of the Orion Nebula. There is a bright star adjacent to M42 with faint nebulosity around it. Both this and the center of the Orion Nebula can fit in the same FOV in the 16".  |  
|  [M44](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m044.html)  |  Praesepe, Beehive Cluster  |  Open  |  Cnc  |  4  |   6/07  |  Easy to view in 6" w/ 32mm. Very big cluster, requires wide field of view, so can only be seen in finder scope of 16".  |  
|  [M45](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m045.html)  |  Pleiades, Seven Sisters, Subaru  |  Open  |  Tau  |  1.6  |   2002?  |  First remember viewing this w/ naked eye on Salmon Pond trip w/ Boy Scouts. It is very nice to view w/ 6",  slight nebulosity sometimes apparent.  |  
|  [M46](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m046.html)  |  M46,NGC2437  |  Open  |  Pup  |  6.5  |   2/14/09  |  Dense open cluster.. 150 stars of mag 10-13 and probably over 500 total.  |  
|  [M47](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m047.html)  |  M47,NGC2422  |  Open  |  Pup  |  4.5  |  2/14/09   |  Sparse open cluster.. primarily a dozen or so bright stars and about 50 stars total.  |  
|  [M48](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m048.html)  |  M48,NGC2548  |  Open  |  Hya  |  5.5  |     |   |  
|  [M49](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m049.html)  |  M49,NGC4472,UGC7629  |  Galaxy  |  Vir  |  9.3  |     |   |  
|  [M50](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m050.html)  |  Heart-shaped Cluster  |  Open  |  Mon  |  7  |     |   |  
|  [M51](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m051.html)  |  Whirlpool Galaxy  |  Galaxy  |  Cvn  |  8.9  |   7/07  |  First viewed in an APO refractor at ADK Star Party. Later viewed through 16" Cas on an exceptionally clear night in February 08. It was well after 11 and moonless, allowing clear view of galaxy and interacting companion. |  
|  [M52](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m052.html)  |  The Scorpion  |  Open  |  Cas  |  8  |   10/31/08  |  Nice rich open cluster.. has about 200 stars... and a few bright ones.  |  
|  [M53](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m053.html)  |  M53,NGC5024  |  Globular  |  Com  |  8.5  |  2/14/09  |  Smaller globular in 16" 50mm. Some granulation can be seen because of individual bright stars.  |  
|  [M54](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m054.html)  |  M54,NGC6715  |  Globular  |  Sgr  |  8.5  |     |   |  
|  [M55](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m055.html)  |  M55,NGC6809  |  Globular  |  Sgr  |  7  |     |   |  
|  [M56](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m056.html)  |  M56,NGC6779  |  Globular  |  Lyr  |  9.5  |     |   |  
|  [M57](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m057.html)  |  Ring Nebula  |  P Neb  |  Lyr  |  9.5  |  7/07  |  One of my most viewed objects. Appears as small smoke ring in 6". Color visible in 16" Cas. (blue-green).  |  
|  [M58](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m058.html)  |  M58,NGC4579,UGC7796  |  Galaxy  |  Vir  |  10.4  |     |   |  
|  [M59](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m059.html)  |  M59,NGC4621,UGC7858  |  Galaxy  |  Vir  |  10.7  |     |   |  
|  [M60](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m060.html)  |  M60,NGC4649,UGC7898  |  Galaxy  |  Vir  |  9.8  |     |   |  
|  [M61](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m061.html)  |  Swelling Spiral  |  Galaxy  |  Vir  |  10.1  |     |   |  
|  [M62](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m062.html)  |  Flickering Globular / Blinking Globular  |  Globular  |  Oph  |  8  |   7/07  |  First viewed through 8in at ADK star party. Good object to explain averted vision with.  Easy to see w/ 6" as well.  |  
|  [M63](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m063.html)  |  Sunflower Galaxy  |  Galaxy  |  Cvn  |  9.3  |   2/14/09  |  Relatively faint at RPI. I could not see any sunflower like appearance.  |  
|  [M64](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m064.html)  |  Black Eye Galaxy  |  Galaxy  |  Com  |  9.3  |  4/29/08  |  Relatively faint galaxy, but able to spot with 50mm in 16".  Imaged.  Saw again on a dark night 2/14/09, and noted that this is a fairly large galaxy, just as big as M80 or M81.  |  
|  [M65](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m065.html)  |  Leo Triplet  |  Galaxy  |  Leo  |  10.1  |     |  I thought I saw a dimmer object while looking for M66.. However, I was not able to find it again.  |  
|  [M66](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m066.html)  |  Leo Triplet  |  Galaxy  |  Leo  |  9.7  |   2/14/09  |  Central bulge appears as star with slight nebulosity.  Under good conditions it is fairly easy to see, and it seemed to have an irregular structure.  |  
|  [M67](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m067.html)  |  King Cobra  |  Open  |  Cnc  |  7.5  |   2/21/09  |  Pretty big cluster, fills 50mm. Has about 10 bright stars, and many dim ones. (Actual count is around 500 stars).  It is about the age of our solar system, which is old for an open cluster, and therefore contains a fair number of red giants.  |

|  [M76](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m076.html)  |  Little Dumbbell Nebula  |  P Neb  |  Per  |  12  |   2008  |  Excellent object for 16". It does look like a miniature Dumbbell Nebula.  |  
|  [M77](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m077.html)  |  Cetus A  |  Galaxy  |  Cet  |  9.7  |   2008  |  Excellent Galaxy for 16". This is a relatively low integrated magnitude, but it is a quite small, compact object, so it is easily seen.  |  
|  [M78](http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/m078.html)  |  M78,NGC2068  |  D Neb  |  Ori  |  8  |     |  This object is sort of a mystery to me... it is apparently part of an array of reflection nebula in the Orion complex, and the brightest reflection nebula in the N. Hemisphere. It lies above the leftmost star in Orion's belt. It should be very easy to spot under dark skies, but I'm not really sure of the scale of the thing. Starry night shows it being as very small, but it is listed as 8x6 arc mins and looks pretty big.  |

Despite a low integrated magnitude, these objects where relatively easy to spot, given a clear, dark night. This is probably because they are relatively small.  Both can be seen in the 50mm eyepiece at the same time, and its quite a sight to see.  |

<td width="43%" height="23"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Many hoped that Comet Lulin would reach naked eye visibility. In the end it was not quite bright enough, except under perfectly dark skies. At RPI  there was no chance of visual observation but it could be seen fairly easily with binoculars. I first spotted it with Dave's 10" lying just above Saturn. As the night progressed it moved quite noticeably on a path from Saturn towards Regulus. It was quite bright in the 16", but it did not have very much of a comet-like appearance; appearing as a bright cloud with a semi-circular coma. After careful inspection, it was clear that coma was in fact elliptical and extending off both sides.  This overall indistinctness of the tail was due to the fact that the comet was moving towards us in the plane of the earth's orbit, and the tail was fanning out behind it. A subsequent observation was made that Saturday, 3/1/09 and it had dimmed quite noticeably in the 16". By that time it had already passed Regulus and was headed through Cancer towards Gemini. I observed it again on 3/20/09 while it was in Gemini , and it had dimmed down to magnitude 8.6 but was still fairly easy to spot in the 16". It had shrunk to at most half, maybe a quarter of its original size, and appeared a little bit more elongated. Still, it was very dim and fuzzy, and there was nothing about it by which was distinctly cometary in nature.  We had to check to make sure we were not actually looking at a globular cluster or galaxy that happened to be nearby.</span></td>

We had a special opportunity to view the Shuttle Launch, because it was an evening launch with clear skies. I was skeptical about whether we would see it from the Hirsch Observatory, and quite amazed when we did. The shuttle launched right on time at 7:43, which we watched indoors on NASA TV. Then we went out onto the roof and stood scanning the southern horizon with no avail. We had just about given up when a bright red glow object appeared moving very fast starting in the southeast. It flickered on and off several times. We later determined this must have been due to a large complex of clouds just south of Long Island. We tracked the shuttle for about 30 seconds before main-engine cut off.

I was standing out on the roof when I noticed 2 objects moving along the same arc in the North. The first was quite bright, and due to the gentle curve of the arc, I immediately suspected it was the ISS, rather than a plane. The other object was about 1-1.5 degrees away, leading the ISS. I was very sure that was the shuttle, but others were skeptical. A quick check online showed that the shuttle had undocked from the ISS about 6 hours ago.

We took a quick look, out of curiosity, not expecting to see it. Because of the glare of Sirius, the only practical way of observing the "pup" is to block Sirius just outside the edge of the eyepiece. But you need to know which side the pup is on. We were not able to see it, but it still is worth a look if you are in the neighborhood. The pup is currently moving away from Sirius and will be at maximum elongation in 2025\.
