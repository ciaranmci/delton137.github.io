=====================================

Originally my blog and website were hosted on Wordpress. In 2017 I exported all of my wordpress content to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with hosting through GitHub pages.

I am grateful to [Steven Miller](https://github.com/svmiller) for creating the theme this is based off. [Check out his page](https://github.com/svmiller/steve-ngvb-jekyll-template) to use it yourself and find more documentation.
